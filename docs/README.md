Documentation hub for the AI-powered multi-agent calisthenics coaching system.

## 📚 Documentation Files

### Core Documentation

- **[Roadmap.md](./Roadmap.md)** - Development phases (MVP → RAG → Advanced) with week-by-week implementation timeline
- **[Architecture.md](./Architecture.md)** - System architecture, layer separation, and design principles

### Implementation Guides

Following the Week 1-2 implementation order from [Roadmap.md](./Roadmap.md):

- **[Frontend Setup](./implementation/frontend-setup.md)** - Next.js app with Tailwind CSS (✅ Complete)
- **[Netlify Functions Configuration](./implementation/netlify-functions-configuration.md)** - Serverless orchestration framework (🔄 Framework complete, needs AI integration)
- **[Type System & Data Modeling](./implementation/type-system-data-modeling.md)** - Centralized TypeScript types and comprehensive mock data system (✅ Complete)

### Development Process Documentation

- **[Steps.md](./steps.md)** - Comprehensive development log with language-agnostic patterns and impact analysis

## 📋 Documentation Structure & Methodology

This documentation follows a **hybrid documentation methodology** with four key components for each implementation phase:

### **Implementation**

- **Purpose**: Technical specification and requirements documentation
- **Content**: Concrete technical work, technologies used, files created
- **Serves as**: Deliverable checklist and technical record
- **Audience**: Developers and technical team members

### **Language-Agnostic Concepts**

- **Purpose**: Architectural patterns and design principles documentation
- **Content**: Underlying software engineering patterns, reusable concepts
- **Serves as**: Educational content and knowledge transfer resource
- **Audience**: Software architects and future development teams

### **Outcome**

- **Purpose**: Deliverable specification and completion criteria
- **Content**: What was actually achieved, delivered artifacts, milestone validation
- **Serves as**: Acceptance criteria and project deliverable documentation
- **Audience**: Project managers and stakeholders

### **Impact**

- **Purpose**: Value assessment and benefit realization documentation
- **Content**: Business and technical value created, ROI justification
- **Serves as**: Impact measurement and stakeholder communication
- **Audience**: Business stakeholders and decision makers

### **Documentation Pattern Classification**

This methodology combines elements from:

- **Project Management**: Deliverables and outcomes tracking
- **Technical Architecture**: Design patterns and principles documentation
- **Knowledge Management**: Educational concepts and learning resources
- **Business Case Development**: Impact measurement and value justification

### **Similar Methodologies**

- **TOGAF Architecture Documentation**: Views, principles, requirements
- **Agile User Stories**: As/I want/So that structure (outcome/implementation/impact)
- **Design Thinking**: Problem/Solution/Impact framework
- **Lean Startup**: Build/Measure/Learn cycle
- **OKRs**: Objectives/Key Results (outcome/impact measurement)

This creates a **comprehensive project retrospective** serving multiple audiences:

- **Developers**: Implementation details and architectural concepts
- **Stakeholders**: Outcomes achieved and business impact
- **Future teams**: Reusable patterns and principles
- **Business**: Value delivered and ROI justification
